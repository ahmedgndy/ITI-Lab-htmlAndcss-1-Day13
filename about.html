    <h2>About me </h2>
    <p>
       I'm a dedicated and results-driven .NET Developer with a strong background in building scalable and efficient applications using Microsoft technologies. With hands-on experience in C#, ASP.NET (MVC & Core), Entity Framework, and SQL Server, I specialize in developing robust backend systems, web applications, and RESTful APIs that deliver real value to users and businesses.

I take pride in writing clean, maintainable code and following best practices in software development. My approach combines technical expertise with strong problem-solving skills and a deep understanding of the software development lifecycle. I'm also comfortable working with front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks when needed to deliver end-to-end solutions.

I thrive in collaborative environments, enjoy tackling complex challenges, and am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my craft. Whether working on enterprise applications or small-scale solutions, my goal is always the same: to deliver high-quality, reliable software that meets user needs and exceeds expectations.
